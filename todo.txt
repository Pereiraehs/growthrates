Planned features
================

o implement ODE models in C or Fortran
  --> done

o "masking" of parameters during fit
  --> done

o multiple start parameters, as lists (or data frames)
  --> done

o enable "trace" for all optimizers
  --> done

o estimate lag phase
  --> done
  
o formula interface
  - simple interface: done
  - parse nonlinear formula: experimental
  - for single fits: to do

o predict method
  --> done (at least partly)

o more argument checking
  - can always be improved

o streamline documentation
  - done
  - can always be improved

o data conversion functions
  - plate reader
  - grofit --> see examples/import_grofit_data.R

o direct use of log-transformed parameters y0 and ymax = K
   - tested, was less advantageous than expected.
   --> not implemented to avoid confusion.

Ideas
=====

o estimate and plot confidence intervals

o interactive data brushing

o interfaces to related packages (Suggests)
  - growthmodels (generic function interface)
  - grofit
  - drc
  - ccSolve
